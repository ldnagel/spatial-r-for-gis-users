# Spatial R for GIS Users

## Getting Started

* Make sure that you have up-to-date versions of R (â‰¥ 3.3.0) and RStudio. For instructions on how to install R and RStudio for the first time, go [here](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/Install-R-RStudio.md).
* Check your package versions: there have been some recent major overhauls of core spatial packages and some of the packages they depend on. [Here's a list of the package versions used in this workshop](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/getting_started/r-packages.md) and some package installation tips, we highly recommend installing these versions ahead of time to minimize troubleshooting during the workshop (the remote nature of the workshop unfortunately limits the amount of real-time troubleshooting we can do). If you're affiliated with UC Davis and are having trouble installing the software or R packages, [DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/) offers (virtual) drop-in hours Mondays 1:30-3pm PST.
* Data can be downloaded [in a zip file from this repo](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/tree/master/data) or [here](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/gvw5r4jlh5nu21ie4zp5htn8ga5pn53o)
* The link to the livecode is [here](box link to .txt file that you copy-paste to, or save livecode to dropbox and link there); there's also a script [here](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/blob/master/scripts/maptime_workshop_code.R) that you can download or copy/paste the contents directly from your browser (although it may be slightly different from the livecode)
  * Use the linked livecode and/or download the script on the repo as a source: copy/paste code if you're following along with the code and don't want to type it all out or missed something
  * If the livecoding appears to be lagging: First refresh the browser tab, and if that's not working message one of the meeting hosts in the chat to remind the speaker to save the livecode file again.
