# Spatial R for GIS Users

## Tutorials

* Text-based tutorial is [here](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/tree/master/text_tutorial)
* [Tutorial with code and video walkthrough](https://github.com/ldnagel/spatial-r-for-gis-users/tree/master/maptime_webinar): Recording of a (virtual) #MaptimeDavis Workshop (April 2020)

## Why use R for GIS?

* Open source
  * Free to use, transferable
  * Transparent analyses 
* Scripting
  * Automate repeated tasks
  * Increase research reproducibility
* Integrated workflow 
  * Similar syntax to other R packages
  * Keeps all of your spatial and non-spatial analyses in one program/workflow 


### What (spatial things) can you do with R?

CRAN Task Pages: topic-specific [lists of packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html). From the Spatial page (condensed):

* Import and export spatial data
  * Common open source and proprietary formats (GeoJSON, ESRI shapefiles, etc)
  * Can handle a variety of projection formats (WKT, CRS, etc)

* Interface directly with other programs
  * PostGIS, QGIS, others

* Access spatial data in an efficient way
  * Directly access certain public datasets without going through not especially user-friendly portals (census data using `tidycensus`, National Hydrography Dataset using `nhdplusTools`, etc)

* Simple spatial functions
  * Intersect, buffer, extract 

* Advanced spatial analyses
  * Point pattern analysis 
  * Interpolation, cluster analysis, spatial autocorrelation tests, etc
  * Landscape metrics (FRAGSTATS-type functionality)
  * Distribution modelingâ€”puts spatial functions (extract raster data to points) and modeling (regression, Random Forest, etc) in one program

* Geometry cleaning 
  * Detecting and fixing invalid geometries

* Mapping 
  * Generic and advanced functions used to produce figures in R can handle spatial data 
  * Packages designed to publication-friendly maps
  * Interactive mapping: increasingly user-friendly packages to produce interactive maps ranging from quick views for data exploration to  complex, multi-layer maps built using R syntax (wrappers for leaflet, etc)
  * Digitization 


## Spatial Package Systems in R

Two core spatial packages in R:

* `sp`: Spatial\*Features (Spatial Points, Spatial Lines, etc)
  * Original framework for handling spatial data in R (first version released in 2004)
  * Most packages for analyzing and mapping spatial data built before 2016 depend on this package
  * Data structure can make it complicated to access attribute data for analysis spatial data

* `sf`: simple features 
  * New framework for handling spatial data in R (first released in 2016, intended to eventually replace sp)
  * Adheres to [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.osgeo.org/partners/ogc/) Simple Features standard
  * Vector data structure focused around data frames (more intuitive for users familiar with common data manipulation workflows in R)

A great (and adorable) visual of how the sf package handles vectors: an attribute table with geometries (points, polygons, etc) that 'stick' to each row/feature. Artwork by [@allisonhorst](https://github.com/allisonhorst).
